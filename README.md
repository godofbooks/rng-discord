# rng-discord
A very simple RNG (random number generator) bot for Discord. Programmed in Python 3.7. Open source. 

This code was developed by godofbooks (https://github.com/godofbooks) as a personal project.

Feel free to use and modify the code as you'd like. Credit is appreciated. 

## Files Available:
rngbot_discord_code.py: The code for the bot

rng.env: The .env file that allows the code to access the bot token without storing it in the code. This is a necessary download for the code to work.

rngbot_discord_pfp.png: A screenshot of a  wireframe d20 that I rendered. I use this as the pfp for my version of the bot. You are welcome to use and modify this image as you'd like.

default_commands.txt: A .txt file containing the default commands for the bot. Not necessary for bot functionality, just a reference.

## Please Note:
Commands begin with '-' as the default. This can be changed to any character you would like by changing the value of the variable "bot_prefix". 

It is important to also download the drb.env file available. This prevents you from having to put your bot's token (which is dangerous if it gets into the wrong hands!) in your code directly.
